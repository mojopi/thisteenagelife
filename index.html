">This Teenage Life</span> is a podcast about the ideas, stories, and unique perspectives of teenagers in the middle of their own growth as humans. The episodes that you’ll hear, and the people that you’ll meet, are meant to be related to, laughed at, and most of all offer a connection to whoever is listening.
            <br><br>
            For us, it's also a way to process what we feel and think. We all have our experiences. Sharing them with people we're comfortable with makes the world a little less big, and a little more loving.
            <br><br>
            We hope that after listening to these stories you feel the same way.
            — Cloe Moreno

It’s hard to replicate real life behind a screen. In quarantine, we’ve been trying to be ourselves and stay in touch with friends, but it’s challenging. As we end school and move into summer vacation, we’ve been learning a lot about ourselves, the things we’re struggling with, and the things we miss. In this episode, we give an update on our experiences being quarantined.

                   After 400 years of oppression and the brutal murder of George Floyd, the Black Lives Matter movement has swept the nation bringing people to demand an end to racist policing. In this episode, we share our feelings on the recent events and how they have impacted us. To all our black listeners: We stand with you and we love you.

                    Not all of us have a fur baby to cuddle up next to, but for those who do or have had one, I think we can say with certainty that they cause immense joy. During these times where we are spending more time at home, we get to be with them for a lot longer. Sometimes they love that, but some of them might get annoyed. In this episode we take a dive into our relationships with our pets from the past and present and how they are like a family member, vital to our changing realities.

                    Adolescence can be messy. 13 is a particularly challenging time — friend groups can be tricky, puberty can be disorienting, and in general, at 13, a lot of people seem to feel insecure about belonging. In this episode, we talk about our experiences being 13.

                    We only know the voices in our own heads. But most people have some kind of inner monologue. Sometimes our inner monologue can go in circles or be negative, especially when we're alone. And we're alone a lot more these days. In this episode, we share what our inner monologues sound like, and what we do when we want to shift from being negative to having a more positive outlook on the world.
