                        With their originality, zest, and fresh perspectives, young people see old things in new ways. Rather than perpetuate the status quo, youth are often more committed to their values and to creating a just future. In school, young people are frequently considered consumers of information rather than producers of new knowledge. By contrast, we're creating a community where youth boldly express their identities, tastes, and interests through creative digital storytelling work, including through the podcast, This Teenage Life.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="heading">The Podcast</span> <br>This Teenage Life (TTL) is a podcast about the ideas, stories, and unique perspectives of teenagers in the middle of their own growth as humans. The episodes that you’ll hear, and people you’ll meet, are meant to offer a a sense of connection. For us, it's a way to process what we feel and think. <br><br> It can be easy to think "I'm the only one with this issue," but hearing other young people share their experiences can normalize conversations around sensitive subjects and make the world feel less lonely, less big, and a little more loving. — Cloe Moreno, This Teenage Life artist and contributor

                        <span class="sectionTitle">The Educational Approach</span><br>
                        TTL supports young people in connecting with themselves, each other, and caring adults through meaningful conversations around personally relevant topics that are not traditionally explored in middle and high school classes. The <a href="#episodes" style="color:rgb(35, 99, 183);">podcast</a> itself offers a model for how to have these kinds of conversations authentically, safely, and empathetically. Our <a href="#guides" style="color:rgb(35, 99, 183);">discussion & activity guides</a> provide support to help listeners engage in similar dialogues. <br><br>In our guides, made collaboratively by teens and educators, we provide journaling prompts, conversation norms, facilitation notes, and original activities that can lead to all kinds of storytelling projects— podcasts, writings, zines, multimedia projects, short films, etc.<br><br>Our educational resources and podcast are particularly well-suited towards helping educators build communities while meeting with students remotely.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="heading">Outcomes</span><br>
                        In our own group, we've seen that our program can lead to the development of a tight-knit community greater mental health and wellbeing, increased confidence, and the growth of skills connected to active listening, empathy, self-awareness, storytelling, and the facilitation of challenging converstions. Furthermore, through the making of the podcast, young people develop capacities related to design thinking, audio editing, self and group management, writing professional emails to adults, project management, and executive functioning.

                        This Teenage Life was founded and is run by a <a style="color:rgb(35, 99, 183);" href="#team">team of inspiring teenagers</a> and an adult named <a href="http://mollyj.org/" style="color:rgb(35, 99, 183);">Molly Josephs</a>.

                        Molly has spent the past decade teaching middle and high school biology and computer science, and designing project-based curricula.

                    Here at This Teenage Life, we’ve uncovered a phenomenon called “too muchness.” It’s a fear of being “too much” that can lead to self policing that holds us back from being our authentic selves. In this episode, we talk about our fears and critiques of “too muchness,” how it feels, and where we think it comes from.

                Educational Resources: Conversation + Activity Guides
            </span>
            <p>Each conversation and activity guide goes with an episode of the podcast, This Teenage Life, which can be heard in the <a style="color:rgb(35, 99, 183);" href="http://thisteenagelife.org/#episodes">"episodes" section</a> of this website, and on podcast apps including <a style="color:rgb(35, 99, 183);" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/this-teenage-life/id1456067511">Apple Podcasts</a> and <a style="color:rgb(35, 99, 183);" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2YGaei3I55DO2I7FsRUd5h">Spotify.</a> <br><br> If you're an educator using these guides with your students, below are some of our recommendations. <br><br> <span class="guideInstructions">Our Hippocratic Oath:</span> Do no harm and <b>NEVER</b> pressure an individual or a particular group to talk about something they don't want to share. Let young people drive, and if you think bullying or harmful dynamics are happening, check in with the folks doing the buyllying and address it. <br><br>
                <span class="guideInstructions">Here are our tips for centering youth voice and choice and using This Teenage Life in your school!</span>
                <ul>
                    <li> <span class="guideInstructions">Start as a club:</span> Consent is one of our core values and research shows that if young people actively <i>choose</i> to be a part of an activity, they'll be more engaged and committed. If you want to go deep and develop a long-term conversation community, start by forming a small, opt-in club with ~6 young people. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><span class="guideInstructions">In the classroom...small groups and youth choice:</span> Start by making small groups (~6-8 young people in each group). Each group should choos their topic for each session. These groups should be consistent so that they develop a rhythm and sense of trust over time. In-person or using Zoom breakout rooms we recommend that groups are made beforehand (put folks who are friendly together). <br><br> A day or two before the conversation, <i>young people</i> should choose the episode they're going to explore. At home, before the conversation, they can listen to the episode and use the journaling prompts in the guide. After the conversation they can do the activities together or at home individually.
                        <br><br>
                        We recommend that for a <i>while</i> groups choose episodes and topics from the first two sections below. We had been working together for almost two years when we had most of the conversations in the third section.<br><br>
                    <li> <span class="guideInstructions">Pre-listen:</span> We recommend, especially in the beginning, that you listen to the podcast before having a discussion. It models active listening, authentic sharing, and storytelling around the topic at hand. That said, if some folks don't have the chance to listen, no worries! We've made the guides accessible no matter what!</li><br><br>
                    <li><span class="guideInstructions">No grades, no forced participation:</span> This Teenage Life is meant to help develop trust and relationships based on personal storytelling and identity-based conversations. Thus, these conversations and the affiliated work shouldn't be graded. In addition, cold-calling or cajoled participation shouldn't happen either. People will talk when they feel comfortable and when they have something to say.</li>

Sometimes our inner monologue can go in circles or be negative, especially when we're alone. In this episode, we share what our inner monologues sound like, and what we do when we want to shift from being negative to having a more positive outlook on the world.
