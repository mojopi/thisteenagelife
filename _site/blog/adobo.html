                Ever since I can remember food has always brought my family together. Sometimes, most times, it is not in the literal sense, we usually don't all eat together in the same room unless there is a special occasion. Instead food brings my family together in closeness emotionally. We all see making food for each other and with each other as an act of love. I know that when I learn a new traditional Filipino recipe I feel closer to my grandmother. It feels great to watch the people you love enjoy something that you made for them. <br><br>
