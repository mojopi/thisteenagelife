">This Teenage Life</span> is a podcast about the ideas, stories, and unique perspectives of teenagers in the middle of their own growth as humans. The episodes that you’ll hear, and the people that you’ll meet, are meant to be related to, laughed at, and most of all offer a connection to whoever is listening.
            <br><br>
For us, it's also a way to process what we feel and think. We all have our experiences. Sharing them with people we're comfortable with makes the world a little less big, and a little more loving.
            <br><br>
We hope that after listening to these stories you feel the same way.
            — Cloe Moreno

            	<a href="https://cl.ly/8a671449f401">Superstitions </a></span>is an episode about weird habits that we do but don't usually admit to doing, even ourselves.</p>

                <span style="font-size:4vw; font-family: 'Unlock', cursive;"> <a href="https://cl.ly/ed2df4ca5437">Death</a></span> is hard to wrap your head around. When were kids, we tended to obsess about it. Now we're thinking about it less, but it's still there, obviously. In this episode, we talk about our existential feelings about mortality.</p>
