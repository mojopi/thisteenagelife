<h3>A Poem by Listener Kimaya K, from India</h3>

<h4> I can’t see the stars</h4>

<p>

I peer into the midnight ether,<br>

But the constellation or the shimmer, I see neither,<br>

I look up and see a starless sky,<br>

Tears simmer as I wonder why,<br><br>



Is it because my sight is weak?<br>

It’s really not too much that I seek,<br>

Is it because I have glasses,<br>

That I’m ignorant to every shooting comet that passes?<br><br>



Sequins line the velvet dark,<br>

Firmaments dotted with sparks,<br>

Must I be incompetent,<br>

To the asteroids and burning orbs that heaven sent?<br><br>



They call them celestial bodies, oh my,<br>

But I don’t have the astronomer’s eye,<br>

Or a telescope to see through,<br>

And gaze at what is bliss and true,
<br><br>


How can I confess my love to my soulmate under the stars?<br>

If I can’t see the night’s scars,<br>

Those glittering lanterns amongst the murk,<br>

My line of sight just won’t work,<br><br>



I want to see you,<br>

I want gaze through,<br>

I want to,<br>

Dream as all the dreamers do.<br><br>

***<br>
<br>

Twinkle Twinkle little star,<br>

How I wonder what you are,<br>

Like a diamond in the sky,<br>

I want to see you, it makes me cry.<br>
