            </h2>
            <h3>By Divya, listener from India</h3>
            I am thankful to those people, <br>
            Who made me fall. <br>
            So I could learn <br>
            How to hold up again. <br>
            I am thankful to those people,<br>
            Who burnt me to ashes.<br>
            So I could learn<br>
            How to rise like a phoenix. <br>
            I am thankful to those people,<br>
            Who made me think. <br>
            House chores were only mine, <br>
            You made me more skilled again.<br>
            I am thankful to those people, <br>
            Who blinded me by their wrongs. <br>
            You made me learn, <br>
            I am powerful, thanks for not hiding<br>
            the cruel world from me again.<br>
            'Cause if you did, <br>
            I wouldn't know the extreme. <br>
            And If I didn't know the extreme,<br>
            I would never know how to fight the extreme.<br>
            And be the righteous and thought sharing woman I am today.<br>
