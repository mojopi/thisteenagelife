        <h2>The Quietest scene</h2>

<p>
My face hurts from smiling more than usual. <br>
The smile that is just a turn of lips,<br>
It's the brute force of the urge to fit in,<br>
not happiness which drives it. <br><br>

I sit there watching people speak <br>
I watch people speak <br>
What about listening? <br>
The voices turn into a scene,<br> 
a scene and I watch sitting there,<br>
a scene in which I donâ€™t fit in. <br><br>

I turn to something else. <br>
The buzzing on my phone.<br>
Well, hopefully, that turns into something more.<br>
Where I listen and a true smile is born. <br>

Behind a screen too,<br>
it turns into a scene. <br>
I watch and watch as the texts float in. <br>
Scrolling down <br>
down <br>
down <br>
Yet again, I watch the pretty scene, <br>
where I don't belong, <br>
where I don't fit in <br>
<br><br>

What does a puzzle be like<br>
, without a piece?<br>
An empty space? <br>
Well, surely.<br>
But in my case,<br>
there is nowhere to be placed.<br>
Maybe I'm the extra one,<br>
which was packed just in case. <br>
Till then, I watch the scene<br>
and the smile never leaves my face. <br>
