<h4> GLIMPSE OF THE PAST</h4>
<h3>A Poem by Listener Archi K, from India</h3>

<p>

Taking glimpse of the past again and again,  <br><br>
Where did it go wrong was the   
<br><br>
question roaming in my head<br><br>
They say ‘no pain no gain’,<br><br>
But now where did my all pain led<br><br>
Taking four steps forward I take two steps back<br><br>
Someone, please tell me what are the qualities that I lack<br><br>
I'm stuck, stuck like a kite in the tree<br><br>
Someone come and set me free<br><br>
But I know no one is going to come after all, all I have is me,<br><br>
I'm that someone. <br><br>
