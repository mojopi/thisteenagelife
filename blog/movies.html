            If I could describe my childhood in just a few words, it would be Goldfish, hand-me-down clothing, and DCOMs. Now if you aren’t a part of Gen Z or you’re not a young millennial, you probably don’t know the magic behind DCOMs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Disney_Channel_original_films">Disney Channel Original Movies</a> shaped my life as a kid. As most of the movies were about teenagers, as a kid, I thought that everything depicted in the movies — the clothes the teenagers would wear, the things they would say, where they would hang out — were completely true. Sadly, when I became a teenager, I realized that all of it was a lie.
            <p>I recently watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Charming">Geek Charming</a>, a classic DCOM I remember watching as a kid, which follows the story of a “geeky” teenage boy creating a film about a popular girl at his school. Obviously, their worlds are just too different from one another at the beginning of the movie, however, at the end, they fall in love and yadda yadda yadda. That’s not the important part of this story, though. In the movie, the classic hang out spot after school, the cool place to be seen, was the mall. As a kid, I thought that hanging out at the mall with my friends as a teenager would be the coolest thing. In middle school, I even tried doing this to look and feel cool, before realizing that it just isn’t that fun. I never realized where it stemmed from, until re-watching this movie.</p>
            <p>So, I asked my friends: what is one thing you believed was true about teenagers you learned from a movie? The answers brought back so much nostalgia and reminded me of my own shocking revelations I had. </p>
