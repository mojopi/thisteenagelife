        <h2>My Life through the Seasons</h2>

<p>
You said, "In spring, I shall love you! In summer, I shall weep for you;<br>
In autumn, I shall grow tall and sturdy Into a tree so evergreen;<br>
And I shall be your sun, give love, warmth in winters."<br>
Now I walk through spring, summer, autumn, and winter; But there is no love in spring,<br>
No rains in summer,<br>
No green trees in autumn,<br>
And no warmth in winter.<br>
I await you, longing to feel your breaths<br>
But you no longer walk down the cobbled paths; The ring that you gave me is no longer pretty, Just as I have lost my beauty;<br>
My face so wrinkled, my hair once so black<br>
Has turned white, just like my mind,<br>
In it, I see you;<br>
There is heaven and in it you;<br>
I wish to see you soon,<br>
But it seems God has other plans; God kept you young,<br>
But cursed me into old;<br>
God kept you strong,<br>
But cursed me feeble bones.<br>
The Earth once so pretty,<br>
Without you, has become unlovely;<br>
Your presence used to get me perky,<br>
Now your absence has left me world-weary;<br>
My bed so warm and comfortable Gives me sleep no more;<br>
The house we built<br>
Is a home no more;<br>
Without you, the house has only emptiness, Which amplifies my loneliness;<br>
I wish to see you soon in the heavens,<br>
But until then, I await you through spring, summer, autumn, and winter.<br><br>
â€” Kashika Barkakati<br>
