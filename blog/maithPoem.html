        <h2>Finding the Bright Side
        </h2>
        <h3>By Maitreyi (Maith), listener from India</h3>
        <p>The pandemic—an abrupt episode,<br>
        That caused schools to conclude.<br>
        Holidays, freedom, and ecstasy,<br>
        Sigh. Lockdowns crushed my fantasy.<br>

        <br><br>
        Being stuck at home was a bore,<br>
        Gadgets making my eyes sore!<br>
        Pouting over the delightful past,<br>
        My room was the whole world, alas…<br>

        <br><br>
        Being indolent, made me frustrated,<br>
        “Create a blog,” my parents suggested.<br>
        I started sharing my little stories and poems,<br>
        Gained friends from across the globe!<br>
        <br><br>
        The latest technology made me merry,<br>
        Met my pals through zoom and sundry.<br>
        Attended webinars to stay busy,<br>
        Even my grandparents found this to be a novelty!<br>

        <br><br>
        No more hustle-bustle; my family was free,<br>
        We bonded over games and TV.<br>
        Delectable dishes, I learned to make.<br>
        My culinary knowledge—now not vague!<br>

        <br><br>
        Books became my companions again,<br>
        John Green, Virginia Woolf, and J.R.R. Tolkien!<br>
        I drowned in the pages of literature,<br>
        My imagination, nurtured.<br>

        <br><br>
        The icing on the cake—online classes,<br>
        Learning in PJs and not much <br>stress!<br>
        Though I miss my friends indeed,<br>
        Staying safe is the need.<br>

        <br><br>
        Lo! Time flew; summer’s back,<br>
        The situation is still intact.<br>
        Masks and sanitizers now cordial,<br>
        We have just entered a new normal.<br>

        <br><br>
        Resilience is the one aspect of humanity that is the strongest. Even in this darkness, there was a bright side. I embarked on a divine ‘virtual’ self-journey in 2020, that I will cherish for years to come.</p>
