        <h2>Who are you?
        </h2>
        <h3>By Ananya, listener from India</h3>

<p>In bleak of past year desolation<br>
howled silence laced back in ears <br>
a creature none saw cease breath<br>
who are you? ashes of dead stars <br><br>

dying but slowly at a sunken sea<br>
surprised cremation, unfortunate victims <br>
fade to the final act of les Huguenots<br>
who are you? a barren magic trick<br><br>

thousand Irish goodbyes in a minute<br>
dim glow roar of known loved one's<br>
as orphans registered the hollow scar<br>
who are you? the rebirth of hitler<br><br>

end of our endings folded in an origami<br>
we may live, love, laugh or perhaps die<br>
on the lucifer's terms and conditions<br>
who are you? a sinner of sin<br>
