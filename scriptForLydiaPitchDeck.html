Hi! Welcome to This Teenage Life, a new kind of youth-driven learning and media organization. Because we're really different from most organizations, we've tried to make a presentation that captures our values and impact.


SLIDE 2
Put simply, we're a youth dialogue and podcasting program that produces a podcast heard by hundreds of thousands of young people, educators, and parents around the world. 

SLIDE 2
Here are some stats. We've had over 1.4 million downloads from 189 countries, and have over 110 thousand people — primarily teens who identify as girls — follow our show and regularly listen. The 50 or so teens who contribute to our show, all of whom were former listeners who reached out (including me) come from all over the U.S., India, Malaysia, Brazil, Portugal, Sweden, Zimbabwe, Canada — over 15 countries.

We've been featured in Teen Vogue, by Common Sense Media,the American Academy of Pediatrics and have presented at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

But we're not just a podcast or a dialogue program, we're a new kind of youth-driven educational community and media organization.

SLIDE 5-9
We started four years ago as an afterschool program  when we began feeling the effects of the in response to the youth loneliness epidemic, which, according to the U.S. Surgeon General's report, has mortality risks similar to smoking 15 cigarettes per day. Loneliness is worse for one's health than inactivity or obesity. Not to mention what it feels like on a day to day basis.

That's me. I'm very familiar with the experience of lonliness and This Teenage Life has been a lifeline of mine. I joined the community two-and-half years ago, admittedly before I was a teenager. I had listened to the podcast during quarantine and then sent in an email which said:

Slide 11
Hi.
I just listened to your episode about A Year In Quarantine. It made me cry. Not because I was
sad but because I felt seen. I thought no one else knew how I was feeling, I'm not at risk or old
or whatever, but I still felt and still do feel so alone. I wanted to thank you for making me feel
validated in my feelings. Your podcast is so important to me and others.
thank you so much.

I was actually 11 but I rounded up. I was the youngest person to join TTL at the time.

 I am one of the thousands of teens TTL has helped since it was started by an educator and a group of teens 6 years ago, where teens would come together to share stories, make music, and art and ultimately publish a podcast. 


Slide 13
 When we began meeting on zoom, teens around the world began emailing  saying how much the podcast helped them, asking to join. And because we were meeting online over video chat, everyone was invited to join, including me.

Slide 14
But nothing about our model is ordinary or normal because we're not trying to do something normal.

And because we're not just a podcast, we dont' work in typical ways. Our listeners and participants — teens who are listeners who reach out and join our dialogue groups— come up with ideas for episodes and record them. Then college students and the adult educator who works on This Teenage Life edits it, adds music, makes art, and after a bunch of revisions, publishes it for our listeners and participants to hear. This generally happens every 1-2 weeks.

Slide 18
Our organizational model is unique because it is truly based around young people's needs and interests. If Molly and the college students who work on the show are the conductors on the train, the pedestrians are the listeners. When they hop on the train, they become listeners. Most folks who join This Teenage Life's participant community meet for weekly or biweekly dialogue groups, which get together to talk about issues each week. The recordings from these conversations make up the podcast. When folks have exams or are too busy, they can hop off the train for a bit. But since youth get to decide how they engage with us, they generally use the trian for the entire duration of their high school experience.
